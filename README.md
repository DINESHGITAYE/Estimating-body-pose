## What is pose estimation?
Pose estimation is a computer vision task that infers the pose of a person or object in an mage or video. We can also think of pose estimation as the problem of determining the position and orientation of a camera relative to a given person or object.

This is typically done by identifying, locating, and tracking a number of keypoints on a given object or person. For objects, this could be corners or other significant features. And for humans, these keypoints represent major joints like an elbow or knee.

## Approaches of pose estimation:
1.  Single pose estimation: This detect and track one person or object.
2.  Multi pose estimation: This detect and track multiple people or objects.
